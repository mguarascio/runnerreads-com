super portable!! Only comment is that the grease from the Pam you spray will get on the counter a bit but it's no biggie if you wipe it up after use.

Don't think it's possible this upcoming marathon but definitely possible to BQ eventually, if you work at it. You don't need to pay for any training plan, just pick up [Advance Marathoning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026IUOX2/) and follow a plan that fits your schedule. I got my first BQ following the 18/70 plan.

Boredom is healthy and profound if wakefully engaged with with a brave gentle heart.  I use some of my treadmill time as mindfulness practice.  Here's a book written by a meditation master and 3 hour marathoner, [Running with the Mind of Meditation](https://www.amazon.com/Running-Mind-Meditation-Lessons-Training/dp/0307888177/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1509448963&sr=1-1&keywords=running+with+the+mind+of+meditation)

Othertimes it's treadmill and podcasts, news, netflix, etc

I would recommend reading Matt Fitzgerald [New Rules for Marathon Nutrition](https://www.amazon.com/New-Rules-Marathon-Half-Marathon-Nutrition/dp/0738216453)  He goes through all of this stuff in great detail.

I followed his advice and quantities for pre-race and race nutrition very closely for a marathon and I believe it worked well. I abstained from caffeine for 10 days prior (which was incredibly hard for me) but then I took the dose of caffeine tablets 30 mins before starting and it worked wonders. Hard to describe but I think it made the whole race feel effortless. I also planned out the grams of carbs/kg and implemented with gels and gatorade. I also 'trained low, raced high' with the gels - I think this has the biggest gain overall.

On a separate note, the whole caffeine thing is in the grey area of performance enhancement. I ruled out taking paracetamol but Matt Fitz recommends this as well.

I use a light stuffable [Salomon Jacket like this](https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Hoodie-Jacket-Vintage-Indigo/dp/B01MG61UH1/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1509033297&sr=8-6&keywords=salomon+rain+jacket). It's perfect for Colorado when the temperature swing is huge and precipitation is periodical. I do not know if it would be great for Seattle. You may just have another layer stuck to your skin on a wet day.

I use it for running and biking. It barely takes up any space in my running vest and fits in my jersey pockets with room to spare. I highly recommend it for windy or cold days.

I'd highly recommend [reading this](https://www.amazon.com/Training-Essentials-Ultrarunning-Ultramarathon-Performance/dp/1937715450/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1508962315&sr=8-5&keywords=ultra+running). It'll help you be far more efficient in your training and understand how to develop distance fitness better.

Also, put what you're doing into perspective if you're worried. 18 miles in one go is SUPER easy. You got this, it's gonna be a ~~walk~~ run in the park. Just develop your fitness well over the next couple months and you'll be golden.

I know this is a cliche at this point, but the ease of running a 18 mile run a week is going to hinge entirely on your commitment to training before you start. 3 months of very hard work will pay off into some VERY EASY 18 mile long run weeks over the next year. A lazy 3 months is going to make it far more difficult.

I know its a bit weird from a stranger, but I'm living the sweet sweet no job life here for a few months in NOVA before I sell my soul to uncle sam. If you need someone to support you on a particularly hard/long run in the NOVA area I will happily oblige.
_____________________________________________________________________

On another note I just thought of. Whats your equipment looking like? Your probably going to want to invest in a good running vest if you dont already have one. You'll need a liter or more of water if you're running a slow 18 miles, and probably 1200+ calories. Have you prepared to be able to carry that? Are you preparing your stomach by eating on your runs? Making sure you know what things agree or dont agree with your stomach?

I always run before dawn, so I got used to mine (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CEFQS1S/) very quickly. I keep it on until I can't see the pattern on the ground, or until I am done with my last busy street crossing for the run. It is extremely bright, so I have to be conscious about aiming away from cars and people heading my direction. 

I also have reflectors on my hydration pack, plus a flashing green LED band ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017WGIDM6/ ) also hanging from my hydration pack.

I bought two of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Coast-HL7-Focusing-Lumen-Headlamp/dp/B005NXPW5W). I wear one on my head and one around my waist. The waist light provides good contrast between rocks, roots, and the ground, while the headlamp is good for route finding.

Between the two, the light output is more than enough. They last about 4 hours on max brightness before the batteries need to be swapped out.

Given it's only "water-resistant", I would imagine this would wet out very fast in any level of actual rain. 

I do my rain running in the [Nike Hypershield Flash Jacket](https://www.amazon.com/Nike-HyperShield-Flash-Running-Jacket/dp/B01N7SU1CM). It used to be $400 which is absolutely stupid and I thankfully snagged it for like $200 which is still a bit insane but I can say this, I've done 15 milers in absolute downpour in the thing and walked away dry. Even my damn Patagonia Torrent Shell wets out in sizable rain falls. 

P.s., like your flair, not many people i've ever met have done NYC via a qualification. What's your training for it and how close are you? What race are you aiming to qualify at? 

CHeers!

I don't like holding my water bottle so I usually carry this which is nice because you can fit a few other small items in the pouch - I carry a chapstick, a few bandaids, and some chews if necessary. You do sometimes have to fuss with it but I find after the first minute I've got it adjusted.

I also like the idea of this because you could take a throwaway bottle and then pitch the bottle and just hold on to the strap but I've never used it so I can't fully vouch. Good luck and happy running!

I bought a [hydration running belt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016PDBRNE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that came with two 10 oz water bottles. It also has a pouch in the middle you could use for a snack and your keys (I usually use it for my phone and a doggy pick-up bag).

Other days I run 1-mile loops through my neighborhood, and leave a water bottle by my mailbox and stop for a drink on each lap.

I have had the quick shot for two years now. I really like it and generally don't even notice it on my hand (unless I freeze the bottle then I've got a cold hand for a few miles!). My only complaint is that it isn't truly 10oz and in hot weather I end up finishing it too soon. I'm considering buying the bigger one.

If you're looking for something that doesn't require a phone, allowing you to go without a fanny pack altogether, consider one of Sony's [Sports Wearables](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-NWWS413BM-Sports-Wearable-Player/dp/B01CQMN0HY/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1493664448&sr=1-5&keywords=sony+walkman).

If all you're looking for is something that will beep every minute or 45 seconds or whatever, just look for a digital watch with a countdown timer. Casio and Timex both make watches that work well for this for around $20-30. [Here's an example.](https://www.amazon.com/Casio-W756B-1AV-Digital-Sport-Watch/dp/B0013MD0VK/ref=sr_1_12?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1491184475&sr=1-12&nodeID=7141123011&psd=1&keywords=countdown+timer+watch)

The smart watches from Garmin, Tomtom, and Apple are really overkill unless you want GPS functionality.
